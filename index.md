## Welcome to Autonomous Boat

We created a 3D printed autonomous surface boat (shown in image) to be used for oceanagraphic testing and recording of data. Stay tuned to learn about how we did it. 

In recent years we have seen the cost of in-house prototyping as well as custom electronics go down, while the capabilities and features of individual components have improved significantly. This has allowed multiple open source projects and initiatives to appear in the field of marine robotics, such as BlueRobotics, ArduSub or underwater gliders. These tools not only serve as development platforms for researchers  but also enable a vast array of citizen science projects. 

The goal of this vehicle is to serve both as an outreach tool for robotics events as well as a fully documented, open source, low cost environmental monitoring platform. Its task will be to systematically sample the water bodies on predefined paths and log various environmental sensors.
