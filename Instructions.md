# **Instructions**

1. Print out the boat exterior and interior parts. We used PLA and found it to be strong enough. Inroder to waterproof the parts, we sealed the PLA using epoxy.
2. Glue the hull of the boat together, once again we used epoxy. Make sure to align the pieces properly before gluing them together. 
3. Connect the battery to the base of the boat. We used a velcro suface and first glued one side of it to the boat and the other to the bottom of the battery. Then we just connected the two sides of the velcro. 
4. Connect the motors to the ESCs and mount the motors in place, by gluing them to the base of the hull
    - To clean up the boat, we glued the wires connecting the ESCs to the Motors to the sides of the boat hull using hot glue
5. Solder the power cables of the ESCs (thick red and black cables) onto the the power monitoring board, as shown in the resources section.
6. Connect the other 3 wires left on the ESCs to the PixHawk. The right motor should go into pin3 and the left motor to pin1.
